## How the game works

1. You choose amount of cards you want to match on the screen and how many cards define a match
2. You enter a game with all the cards on the screen
3. Tap multiple cards you think will match
4. The card you just tapped will be put into your hand
5. If you don't have a match try again
6. If you get a match the cards are eliminated
7. Continue until you have no more cards
